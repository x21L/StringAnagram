## Answer the following Questions:

Consider the following String:
~~~java
String bert = "Did Bert went to the Codersbay? Yes he did.";
~~~

a) What is the value displayed by the expression `bert.length()`?

b) What is the value returned by the method call `bert.charAt(12)`?

c) Write an expression that refers to the letter C in the string referred to by `bert`.

# Programming exercise:
Create a program that determines if one string is an anagram of another.
White space and punctuation should be ignored by the application. 

In case you are wondering what an [anagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) is. You are allowed to use
everything from the `JDK`. You will find a skeleton inside the `src` folder.
